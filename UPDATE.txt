Hotfix #1
- Update Crystal class: create child classes of Crystal class for better scalability in future
- Each child class represents a type of doped crystal (based on the impurities)
- Update GUI code to meet the above extensions.
Hotfix #2
- Implement the state of atoms by using State class & subclasses: 
	+	WithConductingEAndWithHoleState:  the state when an atom has both a conducting electron & a valence band hole
	+	WithConductingEAndNoHoleState:  the state when an atom has a conducting electron & no valence band hole
	+	NoConductingEAndWithHoleState:  the state when an atom has no conducting electron & a valence band hole
	+	NoConductingEAndNoHoleState:  the state when an atom has no conducting electron & no valence band hole
- For each time step: the state of all atoms is updated, then the progress() method of the correct state is called
